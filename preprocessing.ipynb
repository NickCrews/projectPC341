    "## Plans for Cleaning up the GPA data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data analysis task, we have two raw data files regarding the admission information of the universities of California. The first file is dealing with various kinds of GPAs and the second file contains valuable information regarding applicant numbers. Therefore, the plan for our data cleaning task is to merge the two data files together. The main purpose for the data merging is that, other than the two variables mentioned above (GPA and student number), the other variables are consistent. It would be redundant and wasteful of space to keep two files separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to the merging, we have to clean up individual file first. The first step of the clean-up is to replace some confusing column names with the ones that could be easily manipulated, such as, replacing \"Uad Uc Ethn 6 Cat\" with \"ethnicity\" and \"Measure Name\" with \"type\" etc. Then some preliminary files merging could be initiated. Before the merging was happening, we have the liberty to pick up columns that are useful to our analysis. This cleaning process will also reduce the size of the combined data sets. As the two files getting merged, we could do some further cleaning on the newly-created file, for example, we could delete rows that have NaN in the GPA column. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are getting satisfied with dropping the rows that are useless, we would be able to notice that there are some more cleaning work we could do by looking at the existing data file. First of all, instead of having three different types - enrolled ('enr'), admitted ('adm') and applied ('app'), we could explicitly unpack this column and make seperate columns for specific variables that are relevant to 'type', for example, we have columns like 'adm_gpa' to stand for GPA for admission, and 'enr_num' for the number of students that enroll into any university etc. Next, as there are only nine universities in University of California system, it becomes natural to regroup the data by campus. By doing this, 'campus' becomes a categorical field. "
