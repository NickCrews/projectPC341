    "## Plans for Cleaning up the GPA data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data analysis task, we have two raw data files regarding the admission information of the universities of California. The first file is dealing with various kinds of GPAs and the second file contains valuable information regarding applicant numbers. Therefore, the plan for our data cleaning task is to merge the two data files together. The main purpose for the data merging is that, other than the two variables mentioned above (GPA and student number), the other variables are consistent. It would be redundant and wasteful of space to keep two files separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to the merging, we have to clean up individual file first. The first step of the clean-up is to replace some confusing column names with the ones that could be easily manipulated, such as, replacing \"Uad Uc Ethn 6 Cat\" with \"ethnicity\" and \"Measure Name\" with \"type\" etc. Then some preliminary files merging could be initiated. Before the merging was happening, we have the liberty to pick up columns that are useful to our analysis. This cleaning process will also reduce the size of the combined data sets. As the two files getting merged, we could do some further cleaning on the newly-created file, for example, we could delete rows that have NaN in the GPA column. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are getting satisfied with dropping the rows that are useless, we would be able to notice that there are some more cleaning work we could do by looking at the existing data file. First of all, instead of having three different types - enrolled ('enr'), admitted ('adm') and applied ('app'), we could explicitly unpack this column and make seperate columns for specific variables that are relevant to 'type', for example, we have columns like 'adm_gpa' to stand for GPA for admission, and 'enr_num' for the number of students that enroll into any university etc. Next, as there are only nine universities in University of California system, it becomes natural to regroup the data by campus. By doing this, 'campus' becomes a categorical field. "

    "We are interested in exploring how the average admitted, enrolled and applied GPAs have changed over the years. The line plots describe the trend, in which the GPA tends to increase before 2007 and suddenly drops afterwards. After 2010, the increasing trend of GPAs goes on. So, during recent years, GPA does get inflated. This suggests to us that, in order to predict the ratio between the applicants and the students who were actually enrolled, we might need to look at data in recent years. "

    "The goal of this project is to predict the ratio between the enrolled students and the admitted students in the future. Therefore, a scatterplot between the enrolled and the admitted from the past would give us an indication of how our model needs to be built. The data regarding \"Universitywide\" is excluded from this plot because we are interested in each individual university.\n",

    "The ratio of enrolled to admitted could be a good metric for the desirability of a campus. For instance, Berkely and Santa Barbara admitted a similar amount of students, but many more students enrolled at Berkely, indicating that Berkely could be more desirable for students."
