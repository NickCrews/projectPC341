# Implementation Summary 1

Implementation Summary (2): A separate document as Word or PDF is given that describes how your team collaborated on this project.  Everyone should have made clear contributions and the work should be split so that everyone is doing data science tasks (while I do consider it to be important to write the summary, etc. I want to make sure everyone is getting practice with processing data with Python). The summary should also give me any information I need to run your code. This should include a link to your GitHub repository (where you should have added me as a collaborator!).

Our main notebook is playground.ipynb. You should be able to run all the cells and everything should just work.

The main accomplishments of our team for this checkpoint were
* Find a suitable dataset (Nelson)
* Clean and merge the two CSVs into one pandas table (Nick)
* Pivot some of the entries in rows to create new columns (Michal)
* Create line plots for grade inflation over time (Nelson)
* Create bar graphs for the applied, accepted, and enrolled GPA for each of the UC campuses (Michal)
* Create scatter plot of num_applied vs num_accepted for each of the campuses (Nelson)
* Commented and documented code (Nick)
