    "# Predicting yield at University of California schools\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we wanted to work with admission data from undergraduate institutions to learn more about the admission process in a more scientific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our main modelling goal for this project will be to determine the yield at an undergraduate school given information about the admitted class.** We believe it is a very interesting and practical question. Every year, during the admission season, colleges have to select students for the incoming freshmen year, but do not know how many of their offers will be accepted. If too few students accept their offers, the freshmen class will be under-enrolled, and school's resources will not be fully used. However, if too many students are admitted, the school will need to spend more resources to accommodate the unusually high number of students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, **admission data is legally protected, and only highly anonymized datasets are publicly available.** For this project, we decided to use the data from the University of California infocenter. The particular datasets we were interested in can be found here: https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/admissions-source-school. The data contains information about:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The number of applying, admitted and accepted students from each high school\n",
    " - The average GPA of applying, admitted and accepted students at each high school\n",
    " - Demographic data (students' race/ethnicity)\n",
    " - Locations of the high schools\n",
    " \n",
    "The data is sorted by year and University of California campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the predictive power of these datasets might not be enough to accurately predict the yield (it only gives us access to very basic meta-information). Therefore, if the evaluations of our models show poor results, we are planning to use demographic information about the surveyed high schools/counties. To do that, we will most likely use the https://data.ca.gov/ repository."

That means, that **only one numerical value is given per row.** Instead of putting multiple measurements per each row, the datasets' designers decided to create multiple copies of each row with one measurement per copy. The `Measure Names` column is used to indicate the type of the measurement in the row. The `Measure Values` column specifies the actual value of the measurement.\n",
