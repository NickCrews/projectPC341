# Predicting admission yield for University of California schools

Nelson, Michal, and Nick's final project for CP341 Data Science.

## Structure of the repository

We have prepared multiple Jupyter notebooks for viewing the data:
 - **DataExploration.ipynb**: Goes into detail about our initial datasets - the GPAs and numbers of applying, admitted and enrolled students in the UC system. Also, explains the purpose of the project and our choice of datasets.
 - **preprocessing.ipynb**: Explains why and in what ways we preprocessed our datasets. Contains sample visualizations using our preprocessed data.

Moreover, we decided to store the data inside of the repository. The data can be found in the **/data** catalog.

Additional documentation about the project can be found in the **/docs** catalog.
